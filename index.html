                    The highly anticipated sequel to Blizzard's 2014 release Overwatch is finally
                    here! With a rocky launch week, excited players were forced into queues of
                    <strong>30,000</strong> or more players. That being said, once I was able to 
                    start playing the game, I was instantly sucked back into the Overwatch universe.
                    Fast-paced, exciting gameplay reminded me and many other players why they picked
                    up the game in the first place. The new user interface is satisfying to use
                    and makes the game feel much more modern than the original. Something that I and a lot of other returning players
                    aren't as stoked about is the new <em>Battle Pass</em>. With the sequel being free-to-play,
                    players are forced to purchase in-game skins if they want the new items and goodies.

                <p>
                    While this new change to the game will take players a while to get used to, it's not a big surprise
                    that Blizzard chose to go this route, seeing how other video games like <em>Fortnite</em> and
                    <em>Valorant</em> have had amazing success with a battle pass in their games. The game introduces
                    three new characters since Overwatch: tank Junker Queen, DPS Sojourn, and support Kiriko. As a 
                    support main, I was ecstatic about the release of Kiriko, and she did not dissapoint. Her movements
                    and abilities are some of the most satisfying I've played in Overwatch so far. Don't worry, though,
                    I'm not giving up on my girl Mercy quite yet!

                <p>Overall, Overwatch 2 is a nice upgrade to the original game, but the new battle pass is 
                    going to take some getting used to. </p></article>

                <h3>Splatoon 3 Review</h3>

            
                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="splatoon-3-has-had-an-absurdly-big-launch-in-japan_6gvz.jpg" alt="Photo of characters from the video game Splatoon"

                    <em>Splatoon</em> was a release from Nintendo that took the world by storm. A new take on
                    the classic FPS game, Splatoon was fast-paced, fun, and brought in new creative elements that
                    made the game so hard to put down. With the recent release of <em>Splatoon 3</em>, there is even
                    more to be excited about. The classic Splatoon gameplay is still there, but the third game in the 
                    series brings even more to the game. Something that all players enjoy are the monthly <strong>Splatfests</strong>,
                    where players pick teams and battle to seee whose team wins. In Splatoon 3, Nintendo made these even bigger
                    than previous games, with three teams to choose from instead of two, the Splatfests are even more exciting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being the third game in a series, the game is still relatively similar to the first two games.
                    I would have liked to have more variety in gameplay than we get, but nevertheless, Splatoon is still
                    such a fun experience, and I don't regret buying the 3rd game. The gameplay is just
                    as exciting as the former games. The bright colors, fun music, and new
                    single player story mode makes Splatoon 3 worth picking up! Let's hope Nintendo keeps rolling out
                    updates with even more ways to customize your character and weapons.

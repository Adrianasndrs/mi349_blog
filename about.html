        Hi there! My name is Adriana Sanders, I'm currently studying at Michigan State University
        to be a game designer. I've had a passion for playing games since I was a kid, and I made 
        this blog to share my passions with others! Thanks for joining me on this journey, I hope
        I help you find your new favorite game!
